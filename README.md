# ðŸš€ NASA Astronomy Picture Of the Day  ðŸš€

This webpage uses NASA's open API of Astronomy Picture of the Day

## Description

I have created a page that a user can look up the current day's picture or video from NASA's API. There is also a calendar that a user can click to see any previous picture or video of the day.

**Libraries that were used**
This app was created using React, using the styling library of Material-UI. Most of the various components used such as the calendar were also from Material UI as well. Moment was used to format the date.
